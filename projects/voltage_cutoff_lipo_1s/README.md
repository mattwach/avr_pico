# Introduction

This project implements a 1S battery protection circuit that protects against
under voltage and over current.

Circuits like these involve a large number of trade-off decisions.  This
article tries to cover the main ones and provides example circuits to implement
each one.

First lets give an overview of LIPO batteries, starting with the discharge curve:
