Gcode Dialect:

%: Start/End of program
N: Line number
G01: Linear feed mode (the only one supported)
G54: Change Zero Point (XY only)
G51: Change scale factor (post zero point)
F: Set feed rate in mm/sec (not scaled)
P: Set scale
X: Set XPOS
Y: Set YPOS
Z: Set ZPOS

; starts a comment.  The rest of the line will be ignored

Out of bounds:
  If an X-Y out of bounds is detected, then:
    - If the pen is down, it will be raised
	- All movement command will be ignored until an inbounds movement is received
	- Once the inbounds movement is received, the pen will be relowered, if it was raised.

Prescan simulation.
  - The entire file is scanned and simulated before and actual movement occurs

Errors
  - If any gcode errors are found, the tool is never activated and an error message is produced
  The error message represents the first found issue.

Example program (triangle)

%
N01 G54 X0 Y40    ; Set origin to 0, 40
N02 G01 X0 Y40 Z1 ; Move to top of triangle
N03 G01 X20 Y0 Z0 ; Draw first segment
N04 G01 X-20 Y0   ; Draw second segment
N05 G01 X0 Y40    ; Draw third segment
